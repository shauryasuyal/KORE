**Kore** is an advanced AI-powered desktop assistant for Windows that brings a friendly, intelligent companion to your computer. Combining natural language understanding with deep system integration, Kore can control your PC through simple conversations, whether typed or spoken


## Features

### Self-Healing System (Flagship Feature)
The standout capability of Kore. It autonomously detects and resolves common system errors:
- **DLL/Driver Fixes:** Identifies missing DLLs or corrupted drivers.
- **Auto-Fetch:** Scrapes the web for the correct files.
- **Auto-Install:** Downloads and places files in the correct system directories without user intervention.

### Multimodal Interaction
- **Voice & Text Control:** Talk to Kore like a friend, or type commands if you prefer silence.
- **Natural Language Processing:** No need for robotic commands like "Open Application Chrome." Just say, "Hey, open up Chrome and find me a recipe for pasta."

### OS-Level Automation
- **Smart De-cluttering:** Automatically organizes messy desktops by segregating files into folders based on type (Images, Docs, Installers).
- **Universal File Search:** Locates any file across the entire OS instantly.
- **System Control:** Change wallpapers, adjust settings, and manage system apps on the fly.
